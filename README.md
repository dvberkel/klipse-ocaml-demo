# klipse-ocaml-demo
Minimal exploration of oCaml to JavaScript compiler using BuckleScript.

## Goal
The goal is to provide a means for [klipse](https://github.com/viebel/klipse) to interactively compile and run [oCaml](https://ocaml.org/) code. [BuckleScript](https://github.com/bloomberg/bucklescript) is an excellent oCaml to JavaScript compiler and the code for their [playground](http://bloomberg.github.io/bucklescript/js-demo/) is heavily used.
